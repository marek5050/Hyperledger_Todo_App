# Why Hyperledger Fabric?
A few links for reference:
* [Khan Academy "What is Bitcoin"](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/money-and-banking/bitcoin/v/bitcoin-what-is-it)
* [TED Blockchain explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k53LUZxUF50)

Over the last couple of years many of us witnessed the explosion in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin that went from just a few pennies to thousands of dollars.
Bitcoin is a virtual currency that can be traded and all of the transactions are automatically saved in something called a **Blockchain**. There are a few **Blockchain** technologies and one of them
happens to be **Hyperledger Fabric**. When I first started using **Hyperledger Fabric** the documentation was pretty scarce and overwhelming. The following
series is meant to help developers start developing with Fabric.

A few links to get started with Hyperledger Fabric:
* [Hyperledger Fabric: Sample projects](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/samples.html)
* [Hyperledger Fabric: Building your first network tutorial](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_network.html)
* [Hyperledger Fabric Glossary](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glossary.html)

The above guides are very well put together and require little additional configuration.

* [Part 1: Building a Todo application](https://github.com/marek5050/Hyperledger_Todo_App/blob/master/Part_1.md) - Deploy a basic Todo application using Fabric.

* [Part 2: Updating the Chaincode](https://github.com/marek5050/Hyperledger_Todo_App/blob/master/Part_2.md) - Learn how to add new functionality to the network.
