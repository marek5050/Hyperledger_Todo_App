# Why Hyperledger Fabric?
A few links for reference:
* [Khan Academy "What is Bitcoin"](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/money-and-banking/bitcoin/v/bitcoin-what-is-it)
* [TED Blockchain explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k53LUZxUF50)

Over the last couple of years many of us witnessed the explosion in crypto-currencies from just a few pennies per Bitcoin to
the extraordinary amount it might be at the time of this reading. While Bitcoin is a currency that can be traded all transactions
are logged in something called a **Blockchain**. There are a few **Blockchain** technologies and one of them
happens to be **Hyperledger Fabric**. When I first started the documentation was pretty scarce and most of it didn't work. The following
series is meant to help developers get started developing with Hyperledger Fabric.



A few links to get started with Hyperledger Fabric:
* [Hyperledger Fabric: Sample projects](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/samples.html)
* [Hyperledger Fabric: Building your first network tutorial](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_network.html)
* [Hyperledger Fabric Glossary](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glossary.html)
* [Initial Todo App](https://github.com/marek5050/Hyperledger_Todo_App)

The above guides are very well put together and require little additional configuration.
